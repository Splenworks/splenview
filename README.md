## Overview

Splenview is a simple image viewer that allows you to view images in a directory easily from the web browser. It is a project that I created from the frustration of not being able to find a program like Honeyview for Mac.

## Installation

To install the project, use the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```
